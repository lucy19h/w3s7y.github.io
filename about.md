# Welcome to the blog of DevOps engineer Ben West!

I am a young IT professional with over 8 years working for a large outsourcing
company contracted to a multitude of public sector clients within the U.K.  
I have held many roles in this time, including deployment engineering; working
on some of the most complex and business critical applications within the public
sector.  I have also been a delivery manager and also even a technical trainer
and now a DevOps engineer building new digital capabilities for our clients.

I try to be an active member of the IT community, attending meetups
down here in London and publishing my work on Github so others can enjoy
what I love so much!

If anyone has any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to send me a
tweet or if it's a code query, please raise an issue against the project on Github.

###Â About this site
This site is built using the jekyll site generator.  A ruby program which automatically
generates site pages and content based on markdown (github README) syntax.
This means I can write pages and blogs in familiar github markdown and let jekyll
do the rest for me!  

You can find more information about Jekyll at their homepage:
