# Welcome to the blog of Ben West - DevOps Engineer!
I am a young IT professional with over 8 years working for a large outsourcing
company contracted to a multitude of public sector clients within the U.K.  
I have held many roles in this time, including deployment engineering; working
on some of the most complex and business critical applications within the public
sector.  I have also been a delivery manager and also even a technical trainer
and now a DevOps engineer building new digital capabilities for our clients.

I try to be an active member of the IT community as much as possible, attending meetups
down here in London and back home in the Midlands.  I publish my work on Github
so others can enjoy (or maybe laugh at) what I love so much!

If anyone has any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to send me a
tweet or if it's a code query, please raise an issue against the project on Github.

## About this site
This site is built using the Jekyll static site generator.  A ruby program which automatically
generates site pages and content based on markdown (github README) syntax.
This means I can write pages and posts in familiar github markdown and let jekyll
do the rest for me!

I am still very much a Jekyll n00b, so please if you find any issues with my site
or just want to give me some pointers to improve the layout etc. please DM me on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/w3s7y).

You can find more information about Jekyll at their homepage:
