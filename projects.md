# My projects
I have a number of open-source and freely available projects I host on Github.
These are mostly small projects which I use to self learn programming languages
(Python probably being the most prolific amongst the projects) so please do
expect bad coding practices.  If you are of better skillset than I in any of the
below projects, please get in touch and let me know how I can improve :)

All that being said; here is the main list:

| Project | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [scubatools](https://github.com/w3s7y/scubatools) | Dive planning & gas mixing calculators written in Python.  This project has stalled,  I will try to pick it back up!|
| [revels-learning](https://github.com/w3s7y/revels-learning) | A Python machine learning project to classify revels chocolates (a bit of fun really, please check my posts for updates on this project).|
| [minecraft-server](https://github.com/w3s7y/minecraft-server) | A Terraform project to provision a high-availability Minecraft server installation.  This could be easily adapted to fit many other online game servers. (Again, please check my blog for updates on the progress of this project).|


# My containers
I also maintain a number of public docker images which can be found on Docker Hub.
The `Dockerfile` sources are also on [My GitHub](https://github.com/w3s7y/)

| Container | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| [ansible](https://hub.docker.com/r/benwest/ansible/) | A lightweight (<100Mb) Ansible environment.|
| [scientific-python](https://hub.docker.com/r/benwest/scientific-python/) | A Python container with machine learning modules pre-installed.  Great for quick and easy machine learning projects.|
