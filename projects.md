# My projects
I have a number of open-source and freely available projects I host on Github.
Here is the main list:

* [scubatools](https://github.com/w3s7y/scubatools) Dive planning & gas mixing calculators
* [revels-learning](https://github.com/w3s7y/revels-learning) A machine learning project to classify revels chocolates (a bit of fun really, please check my posts for updates on this project).
* 

# My containers
I also maintain a number of public docker images which can be found on Docker Hub.

* [ansible](https://hub.docker.com/r/benwest/ansible/) A lightweight (<100Mb) Ansible execution environment.
* [scientific-python](https://hub.docker.com/r/benwest/scientific-python/) A Python container with machine learning modules pre-installed.  Great for quick and easy machine learning projects.
