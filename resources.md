This page has some of my favorite online (and a few offline) resources that I
use.

### Websites & Tools
* [Github](https://github.com) needs no introduction, simply my goto site for VCS.
* [Mailinator](https://mailinator.com) public email.  Great for those sites you
don't want to spam your inbox.
* [ebuyer](https://www.ebuyer.com) Online shop for everything IT related, great customer service and prices.
* [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/)
* [Eagle CAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download) For PCB and schematic design work.

### People on [Twitter](https://twitter.com) I follow
* [@ThePracticalDev](https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev) do some really good stuff.
