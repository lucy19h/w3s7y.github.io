This page has some of my favorite online (and a few offline) resources that I
use.

### Websites & Tools
* [Github](https://github.com) needs no introduction (your reading this on it).
* [Mailinator](https://mailinator.com) public email.  Great for those sites you don't want to spam your inbox.
* [ebuyer](https://www.ebuyer.com) Online shop for IT stuff, good customer service and prices.
* [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/) for checking up on what people are searching for.
* [Eagle CAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download) For PCB and schematic design work.
* [Farnell](http://uk.farnell.com/) where I buy my electronic components.
* [Atom](https://atom.io) My text editor of choice (this is written in it).

### People on [Twitter](https://twitter.com) I follow
* [@ThePracticalDev](https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev) do some really good articles
