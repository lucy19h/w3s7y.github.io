This page has some of my favorite online (and a few offline) resources that I
use.

### Websites
* [Github](https://github.com) needs no introduction, simply my goto site for VCS.
* [Mailinator](https://mailinator.com) public email.  Great for those sites you
don't want to spam your inbox.

### People on [Twitter](https://twitter.com) I follow
* [@ThePracticalDev](https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev) do some really good stuff.
* 

### Books
* The ghost in the wire - Kevin Mitnick
