### Introduction
Okay, so let me preface this with some potential legality concerns.  Yes this
might be considered as cracking however I remind all that laws around computer
hacking are centrered around unlawful access to a computer system, stealing,
defacing or otherwise manipulating data of which you have no authority to do so
and finally causing disruption or loss of earning through your actions.
Connecting to an open WiFi network and making DNS requests which are allowed to
be performed against DNS servers of your own does not come under these laws.
So, legal spiel aside... Let's get on with my first real engineering blog in a
while!

### What's a DNS tunnel
Without getting to much into it i'll first try to give a simple overview of what
DNS and tunnelling are and how they are used, then explain how we can combine
the two into what is known as a DNS tunnel.
