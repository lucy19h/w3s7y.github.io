Introduction
---
As many of my recent posts have been, this is another electronics project.  
I promise i'll do a IT blog at some point soon.  If that's what you are waiting
for, you might be waiting a while!  Anyway onto the main event, ripping up an
old clapped out Dell desktop to liberate the ATX power supply from within then
re-boxing it into a new case with binding posts for the ground, 3.3, 5 and 12
volt rails.  This can then be used as a relatively beefy (15A) DC power supply.

Dell was the name and clapped out was the game.  In all fairness there was
nothing wrong with the computer, it was just old and I have... probably too many
laptops, PCs and general IT stuff laying around the house that I could afford to
sacrifice the PSU from this one.
