### Introduction
As many of my recent posts have been, this is another electronics project.  
I promise i'll do a IT blog at some point soon.  If that's what you are waiting
for, you might be waiting a while!  Anyway onto the main event, ripping up an
old clapped out Dell desktop to liberate the ATX power supply from within then
re-boxing it into a new case with binding posts for the ground, 3.3, 5 and 12
volt rails.  This can then be used as a relatively beefy (15A) DC power supply.
